Auto resize/convert image uploads to set max height/width or file type. Limit image file size and disable WP 2560px image threshold limit.

== Description ==

WP Imsizer (short for Image Resizer) is a plugin for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) which will save you and your clients or fellow blog contributors from having to manually resize all of your images to a more visitor friendly size. You can even restrict the total file size of uploaded images and even disable the [WordPress image 2560px threshold limit](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/11/updates-to-image-processing-in-wordpress-5-3/) which was introduced in version 5.3.

When someone uploads an image that is larger than your set dimensions, WP Imsizer will automatically scale it down to your desired pre-configured size and replace the original image.

The [WP Imsizer Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-imsizer/) is ideal for WordPress web sites and blogs that do not require super high resolution images. This will save space on your server, speed up your page speed performance, and reduce bandwidth utilization for both you and your visitors. As a result of being able to quickly display your media on your web site, this will most likely [improve your search engine ranking](https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-speed).
